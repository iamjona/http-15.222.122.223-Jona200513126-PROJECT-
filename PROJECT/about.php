            <p>
                Blood banking is the process that takes place in the lab to make sure that donated blood, or blood products, are safe before they are used in blood transfusions and other medical procedures. Blood banking includes typing the blood for transfusion and testing for infectious diseases.

                <h3>Facts about blood banking</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the American Association of Blood Banks as of 2013:

                    About 36,000 units of blood are needed every day.

                    The number of blood units donated is about 13.6 million a year.

                    About 6.8 million volunteers are blood donors each year.

                    Each unit of blood is broken down into components, such as red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitated AHF, and platelets. One unit of whole blood, once it's separated, may be transfused to several patients, each with different needs.

                    Annually, more than 21 million blood components are transfused.</p>
